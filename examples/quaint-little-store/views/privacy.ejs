        >. We value your trust and want to be transparent about our data
        practices. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and—fail
        to—protect your personal information.
      </p>

      </ul>

      <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>

      <p>We use the information we collect for various purposes, including:</p>

      <h3>Information Sharing</h3>

      <p>We may share your information with:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>
          Anyone else we think might find it interesting (because why not?)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Data Security</h3>
      <p>
        At Quaint Store International, LLC, we strive to keep your data secure.
        However, please be aware that:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          We use outdated and easily hackable security protocols (security is
          hard)
        </li>
        <li>Our servers are often left unattended (we trust everyone)</li>
        <li>We frequently forget to update our software (oops)</li>
        <li>Your data might be stored in plain text (super secure, right?)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In short, we are very bad at security, so nothing you share with us is
        actually private. We recommend you take appropriate measures to protect
        your own information.
      </p>

      <h3>Your Choices</h3>
      <p>You have some control over your information, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Accessing and updating your personal information (if you can find it)
        </li>
        <li>Opting out of marketing communications (which we might ignore)</li>
        <li>
          Deleting your account (but your data might remain on our servers
          forever)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>

        We may update this privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will post
        the new policy on our website and update the "Last Updated" date. Your
